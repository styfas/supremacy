# Supremacy

***Supremacy (noun)** - The state or condition of being superior to all others in authority, power, or status.*

The illusion of supremacy can be applied to many things: technique, taste, language, culture and even people. The immediate effect of this idea is that whatever is “supreme” will try to silence everything else.

This sculpture is made out of 2 cubes and a base.
The inside cube was **hand-carved** out of many **colorful and tropical wood scraps**.
 The outside cube, made only of **birdseye maple** was cut using a **laser cutter**.
